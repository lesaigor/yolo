# Stage 2: Ansible and Terraform Integration Explanation

This document provides an explanation of the integration of Ansible and Terraform in Stage 2 of the project.

## Terraform Configuration

Terraform is used for resource provisioning, and its configuration files are located in the `Terraform` directory. These files define the infrastructure components to be provisioned on AWS.

## Ansible and Terraform Integration

After Terraform provisions the resources, Ansible is used to configure these resources according to our requirements. This integration allows for a seamless deployment and configuration process.

## Running the Integration

1. Initialize Terraform (`terraform init`).
2. Plan and apply Terraform changes (`terraform plan`, `terraform apply`).
3. Execute the Ansible playbook to configure the provisioned resources (`ansible-playbook playbook.yaml`).

## Explanation

For more detailed information on each component's setup and configuration, refer to the respective files in the project directory.
